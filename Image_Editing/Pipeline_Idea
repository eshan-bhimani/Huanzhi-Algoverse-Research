Example Pipeline for Image Editing:
User prompt → Agent → Selects CV2/skimage functions → Executes → Output image


So we need:

Input images (diverse, realistic)
Prompts/instructions (natural language editing requests)
Expected operations (which CV2 functions should be called)
Ground truth outputs (for evaluation) -

^ Link to show why ground truths are necessary for benchmarks
(they provide the objective, "correct" answer that serves as a reference to measure a model's performance, this allows for determininstic evaluation)
