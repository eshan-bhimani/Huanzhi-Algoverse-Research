Example Pipeline for Image Editing:
User prompt → Agent → Selects CV2/skimage functions → Executes → Output image


So we need:

Input images (diverse, realistic)
Prompts/instructions (natural language editing requests)
Expected operations (which CV2 functions should be called)
Ground truth outputs (for evaluation) -

^ Link to show why ground truths are necessary for benchmarks
(they provide the objective, "correct" answer that serves as a reference to measure a model's performance, this allows for determininstic evaluation)

Inputs


1. Pipeline Architecture/Components
- Prompt parser/NLU component
- Function mapper (NL → CV2/skimage functions)
- Parameter extraction logic
- Execution engine
- Error handling & validation
2. Evaluation Metrics
- Function selection accuracy (did it pick the right CV2 function?)
- Image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, perceptual similarity)
- Execution success rate
- Parameter correctness
- Response time/performance
3. CV2/skimage Function Coverage
- Supported operations by category:
- Basic adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation)
- Filters (blur, sharpen, edge detection)
- Transformations (rotate, resize, crop, flip)
- Color space conversions
- Morphological operations
- Priority tiers (core vs. advanced functions)
4. Dataset Structure
- File organization/format
- Metadata schema (JSON/YAML for each example)
- Train/validation/test splits
- Annotation format
5. Test Cases & Examples
- Simple single-operation examples
- Multi-step operations
- Edge cases (ambiguous prompts, impossible requests)
- Concrete examples with expected I/O
6. Outputs/Results Format
- Generated images
- Execution logs (function calls, parameters)
- Evaluation reports
- Error tracking
7. Error Handling Strategy
- Invalid/ambiguous prompts
- Unsupported operations
- Parameter out of bounds
Image format incompatibilities
8. Baseline & Comparison
- Random baseline
- Rule-based baseline
- Other models/approaches to compare against
