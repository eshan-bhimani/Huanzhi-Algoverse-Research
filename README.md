# Image Editing API

A minimal FastAPI-based image editing pipeline using OpenCV (cv2) for benchmarking AI agents' tool-use capabilities in vision tasks.

## Overview

This API provides a REST interface for image editing operations with built-in evaluation metrics. Designed for research on multimodal AI agents that use tools for image manipulation tasks.

## Features

- 🖼️ **Dual Input Support**: Accept images via file upload or URL
- 🔧 **CV2 Integration**: OpenCV-based image processing
- 📊 **Built-in Evaluation**: MSE, PSNR, SSIM, and pixel accuracy metrics
- 📝 **Request Logging**: Automatic logging for analysis
- 🚀 **Easy Deployment**: Simple FastAPI setup

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
